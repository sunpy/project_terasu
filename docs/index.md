# Project Terasu - Author's Guide

These documentation pages describe what the objectives of this project are and how you can contribute.

## Goals

* Provide a home for documentation which involves multiple affiliated packages.
* Contain Tutorials[^1] which involve using more than one package in the ecosystem.
* Provide explanation[^2] content which is larger in scope than one package.


## Tutorials

Tutorials on this site should be carefully prepared following the Di√°taxis guide on Tutorials[^1].
A good tutorial will be a practical activity, in which the student learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal.

Specifically to this site the tutorials should:

* Be workflows for doing solar physics in Python.
* Be examples of how to use packages in the ecosystem together.
* Achieve a thing at the end - the user should get a result
* Show users checkpoints along the way.
* Reference more in depth explanations, but don't mix topic guides and tutorial content.
* Aid in discoverability, show people what is there without them reading all the APIs.
* Should be a linear narrative.


## Explanation

Explanation content should live on this site if it is larger in scope than a single package, i.e. if it describes a concept which applies to many packages.
An example of this would be information about the solar physics coordinate systems or details of solar specific WCSes.
